# TimCo Retail Manager
A retail management system built by TimCo Enterprise Solutions

Fully developed retail management system applications with a WPF UI, ASP.NET MVC backend also using REST API and Dapper as ORM, Caliburn.micro as an MVVM tool. Developed by me for self education purposes, plan to develop an alternative application which works with C++ language which is maybe I will use Qt for UI as an alternative to .net core also plan to write the backend part with C++
